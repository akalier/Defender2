# Defender 2: Ultimate space battle

## How to play?

In this ultimate space battle, your goal is to survive - and of course collect as many points as possible! Dodge the enemies and their shots and shoot them.

If an enemy shot hits you, it drags your HP. On 0 HP, the game is over. If an enemy hits you, the game is over immediately, as your ship cannot handle the collision. If an enemy runs away from the screen, it doesn't decrease your health, however it does decrease your score points.

**To move**: tap the spaceship and move it up/down to dodge enemies and get the best position to shoot them.

**To shoot**: tap the right half of the screen.

In settings, you can set your name and select the difficulty. On higher difficulties, the enemies go faster, have more HP and also more damage! On the other hand, you gain more score points from them. Beware the extra challenging DEADLY difficulty level!
